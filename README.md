# Brain Tumor Analysis in Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for performing brain tumor analysis using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately detect and classify brain tumors based on medical imaging data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans of patients with and without brain tumors. The dataset contains labeled images, indicating whether each image corresponds to a tumor or a healthy brain.

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib
```

## Code Structure

The code in this repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the preprocessing steps performed on the dataset, such as data cleaning, image resizing, and feature extraction.
- `classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that showcases the implementation of various machine learning algorithms for brain tumor classification, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and deep neural networks.
- `evaluation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that evaluates the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/GithubSemp-AI/Brain_Tumor_Analysis.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the provided order: `preprocessing.ipynb`, `classification.ipynb`, and `evaluation.ipynb`. Make sure to update the file paths if necessary.

4. Analyze the results, including the performance of different machine learning algorithms in classifying brain tumors.

## Results

The results of the brain tumor analysis can be found in the `evaluation.ipynb` notebook. The evaluation includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which provide insights into the model's performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for brain tumor analysis. By leveraging the provided code and dataset, researchers and practitioners can explore and enhance the accuracy of brain tumor classification models.
